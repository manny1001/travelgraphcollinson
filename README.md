### **Architecture Breakdown**

- **Presentation Layer**: Hosts the **TravelGraphCollinson** GraphQL endpoint using Apollo Server, serving as the entry point for client queries. Styled with Collinson's **navy blue** and **teal** for a professional look.[](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices)
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases for city suggestions, weather forecasts, and activity ranking, orchestrating business logic and external service calls.
- **Domain Layer**: Defines core entities (`City`, `WeatherForecast`, `Activity`) and business logic (e.g., activity ranking algorithm), ensuring weather-aware recommendations.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Integrates with OpenMeteo APIs for geocoding and weather data, handling external data fetching.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

1. **City Selection**: Users query the API for city suggestions via the `GetCitySuggestions` use case, powered by OpenMeteo's geocoding API.
2. **Weather Data Retrieval**: The `GetWeatherForecast` use case fetches real-time weather data (temperature, condition, etc.) for the selected city.
3. **Activity Ranking**: The `GetActivityRanking` use case applies a weighted scoring system to rank activities (e.g., Skiing, Surfing, Indoor/Outdoor Sightseeing) based on weather factors like temperature and condition. The algorithm is:

   - **Rule-Based & Configurable**: Each activity is associated with a set of ranking rules, defined in [`src/utils/activityRules.ts`](src/utils/activityRules.ts). Each rule specifies:
     - `condition`: The weather condition (e.g., 'snow', 'clear', 'rain', etc.)
     - `temperatureRange` (optional): The range of temperatures for which the rule applies
     - `points`: The score to add if the rule matches
   - **How it works:**
     1. For each activity, all matching rules are checked against the current weather condition and temperature.
     2. If a rule matches, its points are added to the activity's score.
     3. After all rules are applied, activities are sorted in descending order of total points.
     4. The sorted list is returned, with each activity assigned a rank (1 = most recommended).
   - **Example:**
     - If the weather is `snow` and temperature is 10¬∞C, the rule `{ condition: 'snow', temperatureRange: [-Infinity, 15], points: 12 }` will apply to "Skiing", giving it a high score.
     - If the weather is `clear` and temperature is 32¬∞C, "Surfing" and "Outdoor Sightseeing" will both get points, but "Surfing" may be ranked higher based on the rule weights.
   - **Easy to Extend:**
     - To add or tune activities, simply edit the rules in [`activityRules.ts`](src/utils/activityRules.ts) without touching business logic code.

4. **GraphQL Response**: Returns a ranked list of activities in a flexible, client-specified format, adhering to GraphQL's declarative data fetching principles.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL)

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Omissions & Trade-offs**

**What was omitted or simplified, and why:**

- **Limited Activity Set:** Only the four specified activities (Skiing, Surfing, Indoor/Outdoor Sightseeing) are supported. This keeps the scope focused and manageable for the test duration.
- **Simple Rule-Based Ranking:** Activity ranking uses a rule-based system (configurable rules per activity) rather than a machine learning or data-driven approach. This ensures clarity and maintainability within the time constraints.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Error handling is present but not exhaustive (e.g., fallback to empty arrays, generic error messages). More granular error reporting and logging could be added for production.
- **No Persistent Storage:** The API is stateless and does not persist user queries, favorites, or history. Adding a database was omitted to focus on core logic and API design.
- **OpenMeteo API Only:** Only OpenMeteo is used for city and weather data. No fallback or aggregation from other APIs is implemented.
- **Multi-Day Weather Forecasts:** Focused on current weather data to meet immediate requirements, as multi-day forecasts require additional API calls and schema changes.
